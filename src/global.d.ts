	 *
	 * @param gname - Search Element's identifying string
	 * @param query - Query that produced these results
	 * @param promos - An array of promotion objects, which correspond to matched promotions for the userâ€™s query. See the promotion object definition.

	 * @param div - An HTML div positioned in the DOM where the Search Element would ordinarily place promotions and search results. Normally, the Search Element JavaScript would handle populating this div, but this callback may choose to stop the automatic rendering of results and use this div to render results itself.
	 *
	 * Note: The callback may freely modify the parameters' values. Changes to gname, query, promos, and results do not affect the behavior of the Search Element JavaScript, but if the callback returns true, the DOM tree rooted at div is displayed.
	 * If this callback returns a true value, the Search Element JavaScript skips to its page-footer work.

	 * such as a save this checkbox or information that is not automatically rendered, or a callback that adds
	 * for more information buttons.
	 *
	 * If a results rendered callback needs information that was in the promos and results parameters of the results

	 * Note: Changing the value of gname and query don't alter the behavior of the Search Element JavaScript,

	 * Note: Only those DOM elements rendered by the Search Element JavaScript itself are passed to the resultsRendered callback.
